## 👋 Welcome

This repository documents **my personal journey through the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)**.
Here, I record my **week-by-week progress**, from setting up tools, to RTL design, to synthesis, physical design and finally preparing a **tapeout-ready SoC**.

> *“Learning to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools — part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem.”*

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am **Tushar Shenoy**, passionate about **VLSI design and semiconductor systems**.
This repository goes beyond simply completing weekly tasks, it is a **living record of my learning journey** in the world of chip design. Through this, I aim to capture the process of translating **academic concepts into industry practices** and eventually, into **real silicon implementations**.

The goal is not just to master tool installations or follow steps mechanically, but to **understand the “why” behind every stage**, from setting up the design environment to implementing architectures, running simulations and analyzing results.

In short, this repository reflects my transition from **student-level exploration → professional design methodologies → silicon-ready workflows**, building the foundation for a career in **semiconductor technology and RTL design**.

📌 Follow along as I share weekly updates, technical insights and project outcomes!

🔥 *Journey from code → circuits → chips continues… Stay tuned!*
